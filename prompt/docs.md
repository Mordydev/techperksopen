Here's a comprehensive overview of the most important React 19 features and changes:

## Core Features

**Actions and Forms**
- Actions now support async functions in transitions for handling pending states, errors, and optimistic updates[1]
- New `useActionState` hook replaces `useFormState` for managing form submissions[1]
- Forms support function-based actions through `action` and `formAction` props[1]

**New Hooks**
- `useOptimistic`: Enables immediate UI updates while waiting for async operations[1]
- `useFormStatus`: Provides form submission status within child components[1]
- `useActionState`: Manages action states with automatic pending and error handling[1]

## Document and Resource Management

**Document Metadata**
- Native support for `<title>`, `<meta>`, and `<link>` tags anywhere in components[1]
- Automatic hoisting of metadata tags to document `<head>`[1]

**Resource Loading**
- New preloading APIs for optimizing resource loading:
```javascript
import { prefetchDNS, preconnect, preload, preinit } from 'react-dom'

function MyComponent() {
  preinit('https://example.com/script.js', {as: 'script'})
  preload('https://example.com/font.woff', {as: 'font'})
  preconnect('https://api.example.com')
}
```

## Component Improvements

**Ref Handling**
- Direct ref prop support in function components without `forwardRef`[1]
```javascript
function MyInput({placeholder, ref}) {
  return <input placeholder={placeholder} ref={ref} />
}
```

**Context Usage**
- Simplified context provider syntax using `<Context>` instead of `<Context.Provider>`[1]
```javascript
const ThemeContext = createContext('');
function App({children}) {
  return (
    <ThemeContext value="dark">
      {children}
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}
```

## Error Handling

**Improved Error Reporting**
- Consolidated error messages with better stack traces[1]
- New root options for error handling:
  - `onCaughtError`: For errors caught by Error Boundaries
  - `onUncaughtError`: For uncaught errors
  - `onRecoverableError`: For automatically recovered errors[1]

## Custom Elements

**Enhanced Web Components Support**
- Full support for custom elements with proper prop handling[1]
- Server-side rendering support for primitive prop values[1]
- Automatic property vs. attribute assignment on the client[1]

## Performance Features

**React Compiler**
- Experimental compiler for optimizing component rendering[1]
- Automatic performance optimizations without manual intervention[1]

**Hydration Improvements**
- Better handling of third-party scripts and browser extensions[1]
- Improved error reporting for hydration mismatches with detailed diffs[1]

## Stylesheet Management

**Enhanced Style Handling**
- Built-in support for stylesheet precedence and loading[1]
- Automatic stylesheet deduplication and ordering[1]
```javascript
function Component() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback="loading...">
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" precedence="default" />
      <article className="styled-content">
        Content
      </article>
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

**Request APIs**
- APIs for cookies, headers, and search parameters are now asynchronous[6]
```javascript
async function Page() {
  const cookies = await cookies();
  const headers = await headers();
}
```

## Migration Considerations

**Upgrade Process**
```bash
# Automated upgrade
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest

# Manual upgrade
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

**Breaking Changes**
- Review existing caching implementations[7]
- Update async/await syntax for request-specific APIs[6]
- Ensure compatibility with React 19 features[1]

By implementing these updates and following the new patterns, developers can take full advantage of Next.js 15's improvements while maintaining optimal performance and code quality.
